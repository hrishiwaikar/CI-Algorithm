Cohort Intelligence Algorithm on 0-1 Knapsack

This is a program on Solving 0-1 Knapsack using Cohort Intelligence Algorithm , which is an AI Algorithm like GA, 
used for combinatorial optimization problems. It's based on the research paper "Solving 0-1 Knapsack using Cohort Intelligence Algorithm" by Dr.Anand J. Kulkarni ,Hinna Shabbir.

The program has been well tested on all the test cases present in the paper and runs flawlessly, that is, solves 0-1 Knapsack problems
which are NP-Hard , in few seconds.

The behaviour of Cohort Intelligence among candidate feasible solutions , the following of desirable properties by candidates among 
each other and their learning ,until a global optimal solution is found is at the heart of the concept of CI.
